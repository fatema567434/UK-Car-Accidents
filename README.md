# What the Numbers Reveal About Road Crashes

Road accidents are a major global issue that threaten both public safety and health.

They result from various causes such as excessive speed, poor weather, and type of  road.
Analyzing accident data is essential to detect high-risk patterns and develop targeted safety strategies.

## Problem Statement
Road accidents in the UK endanger both lives and the economy. Poor road conditions, weather, and traffic are key factors. With no clear risk assessment system, data analysis is essential. Fatalities remain under 2 for every 100 accidents, highlighting both progress and the need for further prevention.

## Goals
1. To classify risks by severity and environmental factors?
2. How does speed limit influence the severity of road accidents?
3. To detect the most location with accidents?
4. To investigate the peak time of accidents?
5. To assess the effect of speed limit on accidents ?
6. Does urban or rural area have more accidents?
7. Do accidents involving pedestrian crossings tend to be more severe?

## Dataset Overview
- Country: United Kingdom.  
- Data Source: UK Department for Transport. Time Period: 2005–2015.
- Fatalities made up approximately 0.5% to 1.2%

## Key Analytical Insights
### Speed Limit Impact:
- Higher speed limits are associated with increased accident severity.
- Roads with lower speed limits tend to have more minor injuries than serious ones.

### Urban vs. Rural:
- Urban areas experience a higher number of accidents overall.
- Rural accidents, though fewer, tend to be more severe.

### Peak Time Analysis:
- Most accidents occur during rush hours—particularly between 7–9 AM and 4–6 PM.
- Weekend evenings also show a noticeable rise in incidents.

### Top Accident Locations:
- Birmingham leads in accident frequency, followed by Manchester and Liverpool.
These cities show persistent hotspots that need targeted intervention.

### Pedestrian Crossings:
- Accidents involving pedestrian crossings are more severe, especially in areas with poor visibility or no traffic control.

## Recommendations
1. Target Critical Timeframes: Strengthen safety efforts during peak accident hours.
2. Review Speed Zones: Adjust speed limits in high-risk areas based on severity data.
3. Prioritize Hotspots: Focus safety measures in crash-prone urban areas.
4. Enable Data-Driven Decisions: Promote continuous analysis to guide traffic policies
